                    Hi guys,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's been 48 hours since we launched and it's been a rollercoaster ride.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We’ve given you a little glimpse of Carlo’s world through the first 2D and 3D animations, but this
                    is very much only the beginning.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you may be realising – Carlo is not a typical meme project. In fact, in the team we don’t call it
                    a meme project – we are building an entertainment brand with the Carlo “theme token” as its
                    currency.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Think of your favourite adult animated series – Family Guy, South Park, Rick and Morty … push it
                    further and you start to get an idea of where we are heading. Building a brand that people will
                    love, takes time. We all know in crypto – investors want results fast, so to show our appreciation
                    we will be rewarding diamond hands as a central part of our development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As well as sharing our overall vision we want to share our first month roadmap. We’ll be updating
                    this every couple of weeks so you can keep an eye on our progress and ensure we stay on track.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the future, we want $CARLO to be a way for every community member to tap into their creative
                    potential and grow with us.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    same. The thesis for this week will be to open up the magic of Carlo to the broader web3 community.

                    the winning participants of several initiatives laid out in the weeks prior. This will culminate in
                    the publication of an enhanced roadmap document that indicates project direction over the coming
                    quarters!
